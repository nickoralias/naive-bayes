This classifier reads in a file of biographies, uses a portion of the biographies as a training set, and classifies the rest of the biographies by the subject's profession.

stopwords.txt and corpus.txt are both expected to be in the same directory as the compiled Classifier.class file.  Enter the number of entries to use as the training set when prompted from the command line.
